# This script checks for diffs between bazel generated files and files in the
# source directory. These files must have the same base name and be in the
# same package.
# This script is meant to be run as a bazel sh_test.
# The env var TEST_WORKSPACE should be set by bazel.
# https://bazel.build/reference/test-encyclopedia#initial-conditions
# In a bazel build file, use as follows:

#    native.sh_test(
#        name = name,
#        srcs = ["//tools:diff_gen_vs_workspace.sh"],
#        args = [

# Fail on any error.
